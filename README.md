## Project Roles
* An initial TSC has been established per above. TSC eligibility is defined per

  assigned through nomination, then TSC voting. Additional roles, including
  Project Technical Leads (PTLs) may be defined as project needs arise.

  represents the top-level decision-making body for the project.
* Additional project roles, as needed, are filled by TSC voting (majority)
* Removal from a Project Role
  * A person may voluntarily resign from a project role by making a public
    announcement to the TSC.
  * A person in a project role who is disruptive, or has been inactive on that
    project for an extended period (e.g., six or more months), or is not abiding
    by the project charter or code of conduct may have his or her role status
    revoked by the TSC.
  * Disputes are resolved by TSC voting (majority)
